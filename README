# Important Information

This repository contains things which I've been working on in my spare time. If you find something interesting here and want to work on it more yourself, feel free, but please *attribute where necessary*.
Projects here will likely _only_ be updated when I revisit them, and not due to others' requests. That being said, I hope that someone finds these interesting.
