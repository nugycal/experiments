# 2041_autotest

## This project was written for fun as a challenge to myself. It is in no way entirely functional, and I am unable to guarantee that it will work 100% of the time. Not recommended for use.

## Description

About 2/3 through my time in COMP2041, our lecturer announced that a script was being developed to allow students to perform their autotesting on their local machines (no sshing or vnc required). As I was intimately familiar with the directory structure of the class account and the autotesting environment offered by the lecturer, I challenged myself to write my own script. This script grabs the files from the class website and then (attempts) to perform the autotests.

## Usage
```
./2041_autotest <exercise> <specific test>
./2041 autotest <exercise>
```

### Note: Currently some features are not implemented/partially implemented
